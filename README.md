Hi Kao -a

Group project: general requirements, deliverables, and deadlines
CSC340-1 & 5 Fall 2022: self-identified teammates  

General requirements: 
  Work as a group and select one of the following real-world datasets to analyze 
    
    -> College basketball scores <- 
    TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset
    Student Alcohol Consumption
    Where it Pays to Attend College     
    
  Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewsundberg/college-basketball-dataset

Gain a basic understanding of your chosen dataset, identify 1-2 problems that you plan to address using your chosen dataset. You will notice that all these datasets have been analyzed by many other people.  You are allowed to select problems that other people have looked into.  

Minimum requirements in your C++ implementation:

    Use 2 or more data files as the input to your project.  (By the way, all the above datasets contain 2 or more data files.)
    Design and implement at least two algorithms that are not sorting or searching.   
    Declare and implement at least two classes (Note: These are user-defined data types and need to be meaningful.)       
    Your C++ project will use separate program files. 

Two Major Phases: Ideation, Implementation, and Demonstration

  Phase 1: Project Ideation and Description
  
  Draft Proposal Link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rbDNaCx8bd5xGO2U9twHXkd4pC8WsigXdJOwb1kuIyU/edit?usp=sharing
  
    Work as a team to select and define the problem you would like to work on. 
    Make sure you follow the S.M.A.R.T. guidelines when working on this phase. 
    Work together to finish a draft proposal that consists of the following contents. 
    Click here to locate the link to  your group’s draft proposal.
      1. Project title 
      2. The list of team members 
      3. A brief description of the following:
      4. Which dataset? 
      5. What are the problems that your team is going to address in this project?
      6. Why are you interested in this problem?
      7. How do you plan to work as a team? What tools/platforms (e.g., GitHub) are you going to use ?  
  
  Phase 2: Implementation Deadline Friday, Nov 18
  
    Implement the proposed project in C++ by closely following the problem solving process.
    Compress the following document & program files as one file and submit it on iLearn:  
    A Project report of no more than 3 pages using a minimum font size of 10.5 points as a PDF or MS Word file. This report will consist of the following sections (this is similar to the DesignDoc you worked on in your coding labs.)

      a. A list of algorithms described in pseudocode with necessary comments
      b. A list of built-in datatypes you have selected to use with a brief justification (no need to include simple data types such as int and char)
      c. A list of user-defined datatypes with a brief justification (no need to include the entire header file).
      d. A summary of the strategies adopted by your team to guarantee that your programs produce the correct results (e.g., unit tests and integration tests, peer code review.)
      e. A summary of the strategies adopted by your team to improve the efficiency (in time and space) of your implementation
      f. Briefly reflect on the following two questions:
            - What have you learned from this project individually and as a team?
            - What were the major obstacles and how did you overcome them individually or as a team? 
      g. A summary of each teammate’s contribution
      
    C++ program files with comments as one compressed .zip/.gz/.gzip file. (Please make sure that your project can directly read the original csv files as downloaded from Kaggle.com)

  Phase 3: Demonstration In class on Tuesday, Nov 29
  
    Designate one member to demonstrate your team project to the entire class in 4 minutes. Your demo will cover the following topics:
    Names of your team members (feel free to skip those who barely contributed).
    What is/are the problem/problems?
    A very brief overview of the program files, e.g., reading the file, different classes, algorithms addressing each of the above problems 
    Download the original datafiles from Kaggle
    Download your submitted program files and compile them to an executable. 
    Run your program using the above original datafiles
    Briefly explain the outputs of (and/or the user interface of) your program
    Briefly comment on, in your team’s opinion, to what extent (?%) that your team has addressed the proposed problems.   

    At the end of this project, you will submit a confidential peer evaluation form to evaluate each of your teammates. 
    You will also submit a self-evaluation form. 

Grading Rubric
 
    Each group project  will be graded for a total of 100 points. For each individual team member, 35% of your group project grade will be based on peer-evaluation; however, if half or more of your peers on your team indicate that your level of contribution is unacceptable, the instructor will increase this percentage correspondingly. 
    The following table converts the categorical attributes to numerical values.  As you can observe, a perfect evaluation along all five criteria is worth 10 points, where the “overall contribution” has a heavier weight than the other four evaluation criteria. 

35 points:  peer-evaluation (team work)  ( The average points of your peer-evaluation will be calculated according to the above table.  In the case that you didn’t submit an evaluation for your teammates, your evaluation will be defaulted to 0.5 for the first four categories and 1.0 the last criterion.)  

As a team, you will be evaluated for 65 points according to the following main criteria:
    
    Timely submission of all the required documents before or on the due dates:     10 points  
    Project summary (phase 2):                                                      10 points
        A list of algorithms described in pseudocode with necessary comments
        A list of built-in datatypes you have selected to use with a brief justification
        A list of user-defined datatypes with a brief justification
        A summary of the strategies adopted by your team to guarantee that your programs produce the correct results
        A summary of the strategies adopted by your team to improve the efficiency (in time and space) of your implementation
        What have you learned from this project individually and as a team? 
        What were the major obstacles and how did you overcome them individually or as a team?
        A summary of each teammate’s contribution
    Demonstration (phase 3):                                                    5 points      
    Project completeness in terms of the problem solving process:                             25 points
        Based on:
            C++ program files with comments (submitted in phase 2)
            Project demonstration
    Correctness evaluation (what strategies did you use to ensure your programs produce the correct results?):        10 points
        Based on:
            Project report (submitted in Phase 2)
            Project demonstration 
    Efficiency-minded strategies: what strategies have you adopted to improve the efficiency of your project?        5 points   
        Based on  
            Project report (submitted in Phase 2)
            C++ program files with comments (submitted in phase 2)
